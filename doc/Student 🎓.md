Students are the primary users who manage their projects.
Project Creation & Submission: Students can create a new project entry, including the project title, description, and problem statement. They can also submit their final project deliverables.
Mentor Selection: They can view a list of available mentors (teachers) and their expertise, and then send a request to a preferred mentor.
Progress Tracking: They can update the project's status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed") and log their progress on a timeline or a Gantt chart.
Communication: They can communicate with their project mentor and team members directly through the platform.
Portfolio Showcase: Public-facing portfolio page where students can display projects, skills, and achievements.
Pre-Submission Checklist: Before a student can submit their final deliverable, the platform can remind them to check for key items like a final report, a link to the code repository, and a presentation file.
