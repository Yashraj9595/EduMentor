- Error tracking and alerting
- Database query monitoring
- User experience monitoring

## API Documentation

### Swagger/OpenAPI
**Rationale**:
- Standardized API documentation
- Interactive API testing interface
- Code generation capabilities
- Integration with Express applications

## Database Design Considerations

### Collections Structure:
1. **Users**: Authentication details, profile information, role-based permissions
2. **Projects**: Project details, milestones, deliverables, feedback
3. **Hackathons**: Event details, rules, timelines, participant information
4. **Teams**: Team composition, project associations, communication channels
5. **Messages**: Chat messages, notifications, communication history
6. **Files**: Metadata for uploaded documents and media
7. **Feedback**: Evaluation forms, grades, comments
8. **Events**: Calendar events, deadlines, important dates

### Indexing Strategy:
- Compound indexes for frequently queried fields
- Text indexes for search functionality
- TTL indexes for temporary data (e.g., OTP codes)
- Geospatial indexes for location-based features (if needed)

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling:
- Stateless services for easy replication
- Load balancer distribution
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN for static asset delivery

### Caching Strategy:
- Redis for session storage and caching
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN caching for static assets
- Database query result caching

### Microservices Architecture:
- Modular design for independent deployment
- API Gateway for service orchestration
- Event-driven communication where appropriate
- Container orchestration with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and secure educational project management platform that meets all the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
