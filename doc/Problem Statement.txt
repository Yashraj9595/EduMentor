Problem Statement

In today’s education system, especially in engineering and technical fields, students must complete multiple academic projects such as minor projects, major projects, hackathon projects, and industry-based problem statements. These projects are crucial for skill development, innovation, and bridging the gap between theoretical learning and real-world applications.


However, the current process of project management and collaboration is highly fragmented and faces multiple challenges:

Scattered Communication
Students, teachers, and colleges use disconnected tools like emails, spreadsheets, or WhatsApp groups, leading to poor coordination and missed updates.

Limited Mentor Access
Students struggle to find the right mentor for their projects. Teachers are overloaded with multiple students and lack structured tools for efficient project tracking.

Inefficient Evaluation
Colleges lack a unified dashboard to track project milestones, verify submissions, or maintain structured records for future references.

Poor Industry & Hackathon Integration
Companies and hackathon organizers do not have direct visibility into student talent, making collaboration, problem-statement sharing, and talent acquisition difficult.

Lack of AI-driven Support
Students face challenges in defining problem statements, choosing relevant projects, or getting instant support for project-related queries.
