Feedback & Evaluation: They can provide feedback on project progress, assign grades, and mark milestones as complete.
Dashboard View: A dashboard showing all assigned projects, their current status, and student progress reports.
Problem Statement Submission: New Feature! Teachers can post new problem statements for students to choose from. This helps streamline the process and ensures projects are relevant and challenging.
