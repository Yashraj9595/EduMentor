## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Real-time communication scalability**
   - Solution: Implement proper load testing and use scalable WebSocket solutions
   - Contingency: Fallback to polling if WebSocket connections fail

2. **Database performance with large datasets**
   - Solution: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
   - Contingency: Database sharding strategy for future scaling

3. **Video conferencing integration complexity**
   - Solution: Use established APIs (e.g., Twilio, Zoom)
   - Contingency: Simplified in-app messaging as alternative

### Schedule Risks:
1. **Feature scope creep**
   - Solution: Strict adherence to phase deliverables
   - Contingency: Prioritized feature list for each phase

2. **Resource constraints**
   - Solution: Cross-training team members
   - Contingency: External contractor support if needed

3. **Third-party service dependencies**
   - Solution: Multiple vendor evaluation
   - Contingency: Fallback solutions or in-house alternatives
